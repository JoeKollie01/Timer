# Timer App

A simple JavaScript-based countdown timer with a circular progress indicator, built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- Start and pause functionality
- Dynamic countdown animation using SVG
- Customizable duration input
- Event-driven architecture with callback functions

## How It Works
- The `Timer` class manages the countdown logic.
- The circle animation is controlled via `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset`.
- The app updates the timer dynamically while animating the progress ring.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/timer-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Usage
- Enter the desired countdown duration.
- Click the **Play** button to start the timer.
- Click the **Pause** button to pause the countdown.
- The circular progress ring animates as the timer runs.
